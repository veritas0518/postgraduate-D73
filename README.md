I feel very uncomfortable today. I feel that I have a lot to say, but I don't know where to start. I feel that there are too many things to do. Today, I met a woman who told me to write messy things. I'm really convinced. A business school here says your mother. I'm about to finish the basic stage of MySQL. Maybe I can enter the Java Web stage and have an English exam to take, I really hate exams. There are still a lot of exams to take. It's really uncomfortable. There are a lot of things to learn. It's hard to learn MySQL today. I don't know what to do in the future. Hey, this is life
